description: NeoForge 1.21.1 API and modding reference database. Consult this when working in a NeoForge project and you're uncertain about API specifics, method signatures, registration patterns, correct class names, JSON formats, or NeoForge-patched behaviors. Also consult when the user explicitly asks you to check the NeoForge docs. This is not needed for general knowledge you're already confident about -- only when you'd benefit from verifying details against the official documentation.

# NeoForge 1.21.1 Reference Database

Authoritative reference for NeoForge 1.21.1 APIs, patterns, and data formats. This is a local copy of the official documentation for version-accurate lookups.

## When to consult

- You're unsure about exact method signatures, class names, or registration patterns for 1.21.1
- You need to verify NeoForge-specific behavior that may differ from vanilla or older Forge versions
- You're writing code that touches NeoForge APIs and want to confirm the correct approach
- The user explicitly asks you to reference the docs

Don't read these files for things you already know confidently. The value is in catching version-specific details (e.g., NeoForge patches `ContainerData` to support full 32-bit ints, unlike vanilla's 16-bit limit).
